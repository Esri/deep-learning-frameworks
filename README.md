# Deep Learning Libraries Installers for ArcGIS

<div align="center">
  <img src="include/included-frameworks.png" />
</div>

ArcGIS Pro, Server and the ArcGIS API for Python all include tools to use AI and Deep Learning to solve geospatial problems, such as feature extraction, pixel classification, and feature categorization.  This installer includes a broad collection of components, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Fast.ai and scikit-learn, for performing deep learning and machine learning tasks, a total collection of 99 packages. These packages can be used with the [Deep Learning Training tools](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/image-analyst/deep-learning-in-arcgis-pro.htm), [interactive object detection](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/exploratory-analysis/interactive-object-detection-basics.htm), by using the [`arcgis.learn`](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/geospatial-deep-learning/) module within the ArcGIS API for Python, and directly imported into your own scripts and tools. Most of the tools in this collection will work on any machine, but common deep learning workflows require a recent NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU), and problem sizes are bound by available GPU memory, see [the requirements section](#requirements).

This installer adds all the included packages to the default [`arcgispro-py3` environment](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/installing-python-for-arcgis-pro.htm) that Pro and Server both ship with, and no additional environments are necessary in order to get started using the tools. If you do create custom environments, these packages will also be included so you can use the same tools in your own custom environments as well.

For an example of the kinds of workflows this installer and ArcGIS enables, see the [AI & Deep Learning in the UC 2020 Plenary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI5Sv_FsPgk&feature=youtu.be&list=PLaPDDLTCmy4YwK56yHaEdtRgNUoPBiZTz)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure compatibility by matching the versions of Deep Learning Libraries and ArcGIS software. To upgrade from a previous version, begin by uninstalling both Deep Learning Libraries and your ArcGIS software, following the instructions provided below.

Installation
------------

**On Windows:**

Once you've downloaded the archive for your product, extract the Zip file to a new location, and run the Windows Installer (e.g. `ProDeepLearning.msi`) on Windows. This will install the deep learning frameworks into the default `arcgispro-py3` Python environment, but not any custom environments you've created prior to running this installation. After installation, subsequent clones will also include the full deep learning package set. You'll need to extract the file (not just open the .MSI from within the Zip file) or the installer won't be able to find its contents.  After installation, the archive and installer files can be deleted.

**On Server Linux:**

Extract the .tar.gz archive, e.g. with `tar xvf <file>.tar.gz`, then run the `DeepLearning-Setup.sh` script. For Server 10.9 and earlier, this would create a package set inside of the Server runtime environment. Starting at Server 10.9.1, this installation creates a new `deeplearning` environment located in `<Server Install>/framework/runtime/deeplearning` and the deep learning packages are all native Linux implementations. Next, please uncomment and update the `ARCGIS_CONDA_DEEPLEARNING` variable in the `<Server Install>/arcgis/server/usr/init_user_param.sh` file and restart your ArcGIS Server.

**Upgrading From a Previous Version:**

If you're upgrading from a previous release, the safest way to upgrade is to uninstall and reinstall both the product and the deep learning installer. For example, to upgrade from Pro 2.8 to Pro 2.9:

1. Uninstall Deep Learning Libraries for ArcGIS Pro 2.8
2. Uninstall ArcGIS Pro 2.8
3. Directly remove any files still present in `C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3` or equivalent location for your installation. These may have been left over from previously modified environment.
5. Install ArcGIS Pro 2.9
6. Install ArcGIS Pro 2.9 Deep Learning downloaded from this site.

After these steps, you should have a clean Pro installation with the Deep Learning package set included in the default `arcgispro-py3` environment.

**Manual Installation:**

    > `activate your-clone-name`
    - When the cloned enviornment is activated, the new environment name appears at the beginning of the path:
    > `(your-clone-name) C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs>`
4. Install the deep learning essentials libraries into your cloned environment with:
    > `conda install deep-learning-essentials`
    - When prompted to proceed, review the information, type `y`, and press `Enter`
    - If the packages install successfully your cloned enviornment is now setup to run deep learning workflows
5. Type the following command to swap your product's default enviornment to your new cloned environment:
    > `proswap your-clone-name`
    - When you next launch your product it will launch with `your-clone-name` as the active Python Environment and you should now be able to use deep learning tools

Next Steps
----------

Once you've installed the deep learning libraries, you can use the [Deep Learning Tools](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/image-analyst/deep-learning-in-arcgis-pro.htm) to train geospatial deep learning models. You can also find out more about the capabilities of the [arcgis.learn module](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/geospatial-deep-learning/) which provides specialized access to many geospatial models beyond those directly available as Geoprocessing tools. Finally, you can add any of the above libraries to your own workflows, by importing the packages listed below.

Requirements
------------

Most of the packages included in the Deep Learning Libraries installer will work out of the box on any machine configuration. For example, PyTorch optionally can take advantage of a GPU, but will fall back to running its calculations on the CPU if a GPU is not available. However, GPU computation is significantly faster, and some packages such as TensorFlow in this distribution only will work with a supported GPU.  CUDA, or Compute Unified Device Architecture, is a general purpose computing platform for GPUs, a requirement for current GPU backed deep learning tools.

 GPU requirement | Supported
 -----|---------------------
 GPU Type | NVIDIA with CUDA Compute Capability 3.7 minimum, 6.1 or later recommended. See the list of [CUDA-enabled cards](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) to determine the compute capability of a GPU.
GPU driver | [NVIDIA GPU drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers) &mdash; version 527.41 or higher is required.
 Dedicated graphics memory <sup>&dagger;</sup> | minimum: 4GB <br />recommended: 8GB or more, depending on the deep learning model architecture and the batch size being used

&dagger; GPU memory, unlike system memory, cannot be accessed 'virtually'. If a model training consumes more GPU memory than you have available, it will fail. GPU memory is also shared across all uses of the machine, so open Pro projects with maps and other applications can limit the available memory for use with these tools.

:information_source: An out-of-date GPU driver will cause deep learning tools to fail with runtime errors indicating that CUDA is not installed or an unsupported toolchain is present. Verify that you have up-to-date GPU drivers directly provided by NVIDIA.

### Tool Requirements

Geoprocessing tools using deep learning are integrated into multiple areas of the software, and require the related extensions installed to function:

Additional Notes
----------------

 - Though this package distributes the GPU based versions of packages, CPU versions can still be installed and used on any machine Pro supports. To install TensorFlow for the CPU, from the Python backstage you can install the `tensorflow-mkl` package to get a CPU only version.
 - This installer adds packages to the default `arcgispro-py3` environment. Any subsequent clones of that environment will also include this full collection of packages. This collection of packages is validated and tested against the version of Pro is installed alongside, and upgrades of Pro will also require reinstallation of the deep learning libraries. Note that when you upgrade the software to a new release, you'll need to uninstall the Deep Learning Libraries installation as well as Pro or Server, and reinstall the new version of this package for that release.
 - This installer is only available for ArcGIS Pro 2.6+, and ArcGIS Server 10.8.1+ -- for earlier releases, you'll need to follow the documentation for that release on installing the packages through the Python backstage or Python command prompt.
 - If you want these packages for a specific environment only, you can install the `deep-learning-essentials` package which has the same list of dependencies as a standalone conda metapackage.
 
Known Issues
------------

The Pro 3.1 and earlier package set includes a TensorFlow build which has long paths. When creating cloned environments, these paths can easily exceed the [Windows MAX_PATH limitation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry), which prevents paths longer than 260 characters being created. To work around this limitation, the following setting can be changed in the registry:
